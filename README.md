# Guess

This Python based project can be considered a "guessing game." When running the program,
the user will be prompted with which category they want to choose from (for example: animals,
cities, sports teams, etc.).

Then the program will give two clues that will help the user to think of the correct answer.
There will be a total of five questions per category in which the user can earn a maximum of
100 points (20 per question). If the user types the incorrect answer, they will be told that no points
were earned and the program will move on to the next quesion.

At the conclusion of the program, the user will be prompted with an analysis of that round
which will include the total correct answers and their final score. In addition, there will be a
short comment at the end using phrases such as "better luck next time!" "good job!" and
"way to go!"
